Wireshark Dissectors
====================

This directory contains Wireshark dissectors for the following NetFPGA
elements:
 - event capture (buffer occupancy monitoring)
 - PWOSPF (Pee-Wee OSPF -- see: http://yuba.stanford.edu/cs344/pwospf/)


Installation
------------
The Wireshark dissectors require the following packages to be installed:
 - glib2-devel (glib.h)
 - wireshark-devel (epan/packet.h, epan/prefs.h)
 
The dissectors currently do NOT build without some manual tweaking of the
makefiles and header file locations. Please consider contributing improvements
to the build system back to the NetFPGA project.
